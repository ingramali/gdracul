# gdracul
Pentest Tool Created for Educational Purpose

GDracul is a windows tool that returns dorks from https://www.exploit-db.com/google-hacking-database, and you can search terms 
in the search box to filter the dorks.

It's created for Windows, but if you want to run it on Linux, you can install Wine and run it.

It's doesn't have virus, but if you be alert about this, the reason is the command line I did for try to make a folder:

"C:\GDracul - v1.0.1" it's try to make a folder on your disk, so antivirus says it's a virus...
