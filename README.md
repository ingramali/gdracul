DESCRIPTION:

GDracul is a tool that returns dorks from https://www.exploit-db.com/google-hacking-database, and you can search terms 
in the search box to filter the dorks.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It's created for Windows, but you can run it on Linux too running the install.sh script.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
WINDOWS:

Just copy the folder: 
	for_windows

Enter this folder, you will see, these files:
	gdracul.exe and 
	gdracul Folder

Just run the: 
	gdracul.exe

And Done.

It's doesn't have virus, but if you be alert about this in windows, the reason is the command line I did for try to make a folder:

"C:\GDracul - v1.0.1" it's try to make a folder on your disk, so antivirus says it's a virus...
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
LINUX:

EXECUTE ./install.sh | THE SCRIPT WILL INSTALL PYTHON2, WINE AND MONO 

USAGE IN LINUX:

gdracul -s | (start it)
gdracul -h | (give you some help)
gdracul -u | (update the dorks from the site: https://www.exploit-db.com/google-hacking-database)

IF YOU HAVE SOME PROBLEM EXECUTING THIS WITH 'sudo', CONSIDER USING WITHOUT IT.
